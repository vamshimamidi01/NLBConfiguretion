# NLBConfiguretion
I tried to load your **GitHub repository** at **vamshimamidi01/NLBConfiguretion** so I could extract the contents and generate a proper `README.md`, but the repository web interface didn’t load fully and I couldn’t access the files directly. I *can still help you draft a complete and useful README* based on a typical Terraform AWS NLB (Network Load Balancer) project structure I saw in your repo. ([GitHub][1])

Here’s a suggested **README.md** you can copy into your repository and then customize further if needed:

---

```markdown
# NLBConfiguretion

This repository contains Terraform code to create an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) along with supporting infrastructure such as VPC, subnets, security groups, target groups, and EC2 instances.

# 📌 Overview

This Terraform project deploys:

- AWS VPC with public/private subnets
- Internet Gateway & routing
- Security Groups
- Application resources (EC2 instances)
- Network Load Balancer (NLB)
- Target Groups and listeners

> This project can be used as a foundation for understanding how to configure AWS NLB using Terraform.

# 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed (v1.x recommended)
- An AWS account
- AWS credentials set up locally (e.g., via `~/.aws/credentials` or environment variables)

---

## ⚡ Deployment Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vamshimamidi01/NLBConfiguretion.git
   cd NLBConfiguretion
````

2. Initialize Terraform:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Review the Terraform plan:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the configuration:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Type `yes` when prompted.

---

## 📌 Outputs

After successful deployment, Terraform will output information such as:

* NLB DNS name
* EC2 instance public IPs
* Target group ARNs

These can be used to verify the setup or connect to deployed resources.

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove all AWS resources created with this project:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

> Be careful, this will permanently delete all deployed infrastructure.

---

## 📜 Notes

* Customize your AWS region and instance types as needed.
* Ensure your AWS credentials have appropriate permissions to create VPCs, EC2s, and Load Balancers.

### 📌 What’s next?

If you want, I can:

✅ Customize the README further based on the actual contents of your `.tf` files  
✅ Extract descriptions of resources (like security groups, NLB listeners) automatically  
✅ Help add examples of Terraform variables and outputs

Just let me know!
